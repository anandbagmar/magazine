Continuous Design

Mike Gardiner

I'm tucked away inside a dimly lit "chill out" room amid red beanbags when Andrew pings me on Google Hangout. My Macs camera bumps up its ISO in an effort to make some use of the low light, segregating the image into pixelated squares in the process. For a brief moment it looks like I'm a stranded hiker, warmed by a lone candle, calling from my mountain cave refuge on a turn of the century mobile phone. I apologise to him - I searched for a light switch, but it looks like no-one thought to put any lighting in this space other than the red bulbed lamp. Maybe it's my fault for choosing this room (it's the only quiet place I can find), or maybe no-one ever intended it to be used this way when it was designed, years ago. In the end I save Andrew the picture of my grainy face by abandoning the video.

About Andrew / What's wrong with the current world

"The accepted practice is not to redesign."

There's a traditional approach to marketing that sits behind the design methods we apply to software. It's an approach that's worked for creative agencies forever. Magazines, TV advertisements, advertising campaigns - all these things are planned meticulously up front. In some cases, it's necessary - after all, it's harder to change an adverisement that's aired, or a magazine that's been printed than it is to change software.

But this is real: most software design is still usually outsourced to firms who are traditionally marketing "creative" companies. They're expensive, and they apply the same methods they know in the world of traditional media to software. They'll deliver you a pixel perfect layout of your entire application, and they'll charge you for it. It's what they know.

"But it's all just documentation, really." says Andrew, "Comps, mockups, pitches, they're just like requirements: they're all documentation. Visual documentation." What's worse is that we freeze this documentation as The Design, a canonical reference. And as with anything that's frozen for a long period of time, you stop talking about it. You stop bringing up the design for discussion or being aware that it needs adaptation. Worse still, there's a tendency to fall back to what you absolutely know, and so the design starts driving the product.

"Even though we have teams building products in an agile fashion the design is segmented off as something that has to be done first and up front. We have this happy agile paradise only *once* everything's been designed up front.", Andrew quips.

In other facets of software development, we know that the product changes. And so the design needs to change too. When we get feedback, change and pivot on our product, we need to pivot our design. And the traditional design process does not start and stop in the same fashion as our agile development mentality.

"There's so much waste in designing everything up front. We want to be leaner."

Where does continuous design come into it?

So why don't we apply the same practices we do in writing software and product development, to design?

"It's coming from the same place as everything we do, it's just an evolution into a new area for agile development.", he says on continuous design. "It's about being involved in the whole process."

"You create design legacy. It's there just like development legacy. Pulling along this old mentality. You know, you have this old legacy codebase. And every time you start working on it, you have to learn all this baggage. The same applies to design."

Convincing people to do Continuous Design

Often clients will ask for design work up front to get you to prove your worth. I've had to do this on a few clients. It's like pitching your ability to do a project by doing the whole project. It's like, hey why don't you spike out a mainframe or a messaging bus solution in a two week spike so we can see what you're made of? It's like influencing a whole project from the pitch, without any feedback.


But now we turn the tables. We take an approach to a few key areas that are little more than wireframes. We know that user experience trumps pretty pictures when it comes to products.

Ideally, you accept you'll have to do a little bit of a pitch, but it's more an interpretation of how we would approach a problem? And fill in the gaps with evidence of what we've done before, especially showing how we've evolved something. There's no way to pivot from a signed-off pixel perfect design, you can't change your course from that.

Sometimes you can avoid designing anything for a pitch. We recently started analysis on a very complicated project, there were something like 40 different views and flows for how you could do this one action. So rather than designing something big up front to cater for all this, we took what the competitors had done and put that in front of users, gathered feedback, evaluated them and then started designing and building a solution based on the feedback.

We recently had to pitch for a project that was replacing their customer facing website. They basically had bought a design from a marketing firm as their landing page, and then backed it all with an off the shelf product. But the design between the two doesn't flow, and they don't have any flexibility in the current design.




==================
How does continuous design fit into a project?

Build the smallest thing first as a platform. Know you'll change it and build it out. Stop when you've done enough. Jeff Patton's lean approach to products talks about this. 



==================
How does it work for Andrew in practice?

Prioritise your features and then build a short buffer in Iteration 0. Iteration 0 often has a bit of build up, infra set up, a little time to get running so it's the perfect time to get your design buffer up. Here's the design of the first story we're going to play. Then works closely with the developers AND the business.

Fight being a designer, fight the pretty pictures.
Fast feedback by putting things in front of users regularly.

Have to refactor like you would a codebase. Why do we have three different styles for a particular function? Why do we have three ways to notify users? You learn what works better, and you can gravitate to the best (if you can change your design).

What helps tools etc?
Traditional design would be a photoshop mockup. Mockups are documentation. Documentation is difficult to change and gets out of date quickly. Instead, you can design and prototype in CSS. You can actually flow this design into the finished product. As a designer you're no longer just projecting a good looking vision, you can be involved in the development of the product.

Like we're seeing NoSQL for example, I think there's a NoPS movement starting up. It revolves around using CSS3 for prototypes that can actually become product. These days, most of what you can do for a layout in Photoshop, you can do in CSS. And your prototype is much closer to the real world. It's really a change of development perspective to a place where you can rapidly prototype type. And it looks and behaves like the final product. It also let's designers and devs talk a common language.

I'll probably still do some sketching and Photoshop here and there, but it's for wireframing and layout, not for perfecting pixels in the design.

A good designer works all the way down to see the feedback on his work and then circles all that back into ideation, covering analysis, design and development. You need a good designer who's strong on producing work quickly. There are actually a lot of these people, because traditional marketing work has such a rush and a push of doing things quickly anyway - quote on a Thursday and pitch on a Monday.


Refactoring software has more perceived value than refactoring design. I have a button set at the moment which is a semi default mobile set and I'm starting to hate it, I see better alternatives. But I have to balance wanting the change from an aesthetic point of view, with the effect of the change on the developers and on the use of the application. It's a constant fight as a designer. "My life is driven around making things look good. When do you say, 'This looks good enough'?". When does designer masturbation finish and functionality is usable? "The most beautiful system you can build is not necessarily the most effective. But you have a secret weapon - users are your barometer or your gauge."

Classic trap with BUFD is to raise a card near the end of the project for "UI Tweaks" which is always ultimately deprioritised. You're much better raising visual defects and slotting them in to the process. Anything that doesn't match the intended design is a bug like anything else. 

"There needs to be a revolution in the marketing work. It's such a bloated process and full of wasted energy. And it doesn't work for software, especially in agile development. It just creates the same 'chuck it over the fence' mentality that we've fought from development to testers, and from testing to operations and production."

There's a perception that designs can't go back to the agencies because they are too expensive. And if you've blown all your design budget up front, they are. But if you work with a consultant over a project you'll find you probably have a comparable dollar cost and a much better build because we will work tightly with the dev team and just build what we need. And that doesn't even take into account the long term cost.

Products change, not just in development, but while they're running. What's important one day in a product may not be the next. We need dynamic designs that are responsive to the content in the application. And you just can't do that when you've locked in your design 3 months ago for X dollars. No system is static, we know this from a code perspective. And it's also true from a design perspective.

Calendar picker example, start with something. Devs go "we found this that works". Incorporate that back into the design because it's a lot easier to skin something you know works than to develop a bespoke solution for something so universal. Make that the canonical part of the design though.



Tell me on the project plan where the continuous design touched you? "It touches me everywhere on my body. It's like one of those holistic healers."
