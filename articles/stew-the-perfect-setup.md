###### What is your story about?
Stewarts opinionated perspective on how software development should be done. Lightweight, iterative, mobile and responsive first. Only change when you've got the data (evidence-based). Specific tech; no tools; no BA/IM/PM

###### What makes it interesting?
It's goes against how TW organises it's teams and projects. It may not be true but it's certainly contentious

###### Can you tell me one interesting fact, snippet or idea from your story?
"some people get offended by my no BA/IM/PM stance"

###### What would the headline be?


###### Roughly how long do you think it would be?
2 pages: 500 words


## In Progress
if it was up to me: automated infrastructure from day 1 (usually heroku first, migrate to your own if and when necessary), APIs from day one, multiple APIs and integrated systems over large proprietary solutions, mobile first, responsive design first then measure devices/usage and decide whether to invest in native at all

In terms of tech, it seems to be a combination of AWS, Ruby, Javascript/Node, Clojure (if you want JVM)â€¦ maybe something like OpenStack as an open source backend

In terms of approach, the success stories seem to be small teams of all hands on people. Devs, designers, testers together, no managers (if this doesn't scale, so be it, I'd rather not be enterprise scale)

Less tools (JIRA/Mingle) in favour of either no tools or lightweight Trello-style, less meetings and no iterations
