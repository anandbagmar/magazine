You know in jaws when the camera zooms out and in on Roy Scheider when he hears there's been another attack? "I think I just wrote a factory in JavaScriptâ€¦"

So what we're doing is sometimes we need to connect to a mongodb replica set and sometimes we don't, so we have a bunch of options we define ourself and we need something to tell us which client to use in our environment.

"I don't feel great about it, though. I mean, I never write factories in Ruby." like that's some sort of penance, I thought, my distaste clearly visible on my face. Always perceptive, Alex asked: "How would you have done it?".

"So you need an object that makes another object?" I could feel a rush of something crashing down on me, like I was standing at the bottom of a deep canyon. And someone was filling it with water. Dirty, sewagey-brown, factory water. "What's that called?" A factory, Alex said. In unison with some other random programmer who happened to be in earshot. He looked at me like I was still nursing paper cuts from thumbing the BASIC programmers manual*.

It doesn't *feel* right, I said. But I felt, as I often do when I'm talking to people far smart than I, that I was toeing the precipice of a long, (spiky?) drop into an unknown, dark hole. At the bottom I could almost make out the bodies of Java programmers who had dared buck the Industrial trend. All 3 of them.

Well if I was feeling JavaScripty, I would've probably pumped the whole thing in as a nested callback. You know "Here are my options, here's what I want to do, go do it." I even dropped the words "continuation passing" like raw meat dropped by a thief, sprinting away from a vicious, biting, zombie horde. I mean, it flows with the async style *even* if what you're doing isn't actually async. But it means you need to know even less about the implementation. "Here are my options, here's what I want to do."

* Yes I had a copy. Back from the days when computers came with programming manuals.
